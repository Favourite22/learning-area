    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

   <p1> This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p1>

    <p2>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li> 175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
     <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
     <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
     <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
     <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
     <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>

    <p3>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p3>

    <h4>Storage</h4>

    <p4>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p4>

    <p5>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p5>
